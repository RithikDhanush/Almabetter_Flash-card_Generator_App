## About The Project (Flashcard )

"This project was mainly created using ReactJS, and it includes three main pages."

```bash

2) My Flashcard page 
3) Flashcad Details page  with  share page 
```


1) Create Flashcard Page:-
   
   -This page allows the user to create a new flashcard. For this page, Formik is used to create input boxes, which are validated using Yup. Formik simplifies     the process of handling form inputs and form validation in React. Yup is a library that allows developers to create schemas to validate form inputs.

2) My Flashcard Page:-

   -This page displays all the flashcards that the user has created. The My Flashcard UI component is designed separately, and the input data is mapped to it.     This page allows the user to view all the flashcards they have created.

3) FlashcardDetails Page:-
